Debouncing in Javascript is an exercise to enhance browser performance during any time-consuming computations. 
If such a method is invoked frequently then it may degrade our web app performance. Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that a time-consuming task does not fire so often. In other words, it limits rates at which functions get invoked

Application ==>
Debouncing can be implemented where searching works like when the user will be typing in the search box and the search results will come from the server. 
There we can hit server API after the user stops typing(after a certain delay). 
Here if on every change there is frequent server API hit then it will degrade our server performance very much.
Another application of debouncing is in content-loading webpages like Facebook and Twitter where the user keeps on scrolling. 
In these scenarios, if the scroll event is fired too frequently, there might be a performance impact, as it contains lots of videos and images. 
Thus the scroll event must make use of debouncing.
